## Challenge description

<p>
In this challenge, you must create an application to train what you have learned so far in ReactJS

This will be an application where your main objective is to add some code snippets so that the image upload application works correctly. 
  You will receive an application with many features and styles already implemented. It must make requests to its own Next.js API that will return data 
  from FaunaDB (database) and ImgBB (image hosting service). The implemented interface must follow Figma's layout. You will have access to 4 files to implement:
</p>

  -   **Infinite Queries and Mutations with React Query;**
  -   **Form submission with React Hook Form;**
  -   **Modal and Toast display with Chakra UI;**
  -   **Among others.**

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the full project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

* **Npm** is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

* **Yarn** is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general.  [Download Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
